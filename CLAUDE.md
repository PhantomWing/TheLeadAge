# The Lead Age - `version/26.1`

**This file describes the `version/26.1` line**: Minecraft 26.1.2 (the jar covers 26.1, 26.1.1 and 26.1.2), Fabric and NeoForge.
Built with Architectury Loom without remapping (`loom-no-remap`): Minecraft 26.x ships unobfuscated, so there are no mappings and `shadowJar` is the shipped jar.

It belongs to whichever folder has this branch checked out - the main `TheLeadAge` folder or a worktree
under `TheLeadAge/.worktrees/`. A session started in a worktree also loads the main folder's CLAUDE.md,
which describes another line; for this folder, this file is the one that applies. Confirm with
`git branch --show-current`. `MinecraftDeveloperPortal/data/mods.json` lists every line of the mod.

A vanilla-friendly expansion that adds lead, a new metal resource. Mod ID `theleadage`. A
sister mod to The Silver Age.

## Tests

The game tests are split so that nothing version-specific reaches a test body: the test classes and
`GameTests` (one entry per test) are the same on every line, `GameTestRegistration` changes only
with registration, and `TestCompat` holds each call whose shape differs between versions.
Porting a test is its body plus its `GameTests` entry, copied as-is; see `verification.md`.

`scenarios/` holds the play scenarios the portal's Play scenarios check runs as a player. They are
plain JSON and copy across lines unchanged.

## This line

- Uploads are tagged 26.1.2 only, on purpose: the NeoForge builds for 26.1 and 26.1.1 lack the `LootModifier` priority argument this mod compiles against, so the jar would fail there (see `gradle.properties`).
- Java 25, no mappings and no Parchment (Mojang names are the runtime names). `org.gradle.java.home` is pinned in `gradle.properties` to a JDK on this machine; if the daemon fails to start, check that path first.
- Datagen: `:neoforge:runData`. Output: `common/src/generated/resources`, never hand-edited.
- Game tests in `neoforge/src/test`, run with `:neoforge:runGameTest`. Laid out with the test shim above.
- 5 play scenarios in `scenarios/`.
- Published with `publishMods` from `fabric/build.gradle` and `neoforge/build.gradle`, with the `-PpublishDryRun` flag. Uploads are tagged from `supported_minecraft_versions`, which leaves out `26.1` and `26.1.1` of the rung.
- GitHub Actions: `release.yml`.
- Hand-authored access wideners and transformers: `common/src/main/resources/theleadage.accesswidener` and `neoforge/src/main/resources/META-INF/accesstransformer.cfg`. A first suspect when a port fails to load.
