# The Lead Age - `version/1.21.10`

**This file describes the `version/1.21.10` line**: Minecraft 1.21.10 (the jar covers 1.21.9 and 1.21.10), Fabric and NeoForge.
Built with Architectury Loom (`dev.architectury.loom`) with Mojang mappings layered with Parchment; `remapJar` is the shipped jar.

It belongs to whichever folder has this branch checked out - the main `TheLeadAge` folder or a worktree
under `TheLeadAge/.worktrees/`. A session started in a worktree also loads the main folder's CLAUDE.md,
which describes another line; for this folder, this file is the one that applies. Confirm with
`git branch --show-current`. `MinecraftDeveloperPortal/data/mods.json` lists every line of the mod.

A vanilla-friendly expansion that adds lead, a new metal resource. Mod ID `theleadage`. A
sister mod to The Silver Age.

## Tests

The game tests are split so that nothing version-specific reaches a test body: the test classes and
`GameTests` (one entry per test) are the same on every line, `GameTestRegistration` changes only
with registration, and `TestCompat` holds each call whose shape differs between versions.
Porting a test is its body plus its `GameTests` entry, copied as-is; see `verification.md`.

`scenarios/` holds the play scenarios the portal's Play scenarios check runs as a player. They are
plain JSON and copy across lines unchanged. `scenarios/server` holds those its Play scenarios on a server check
plays on the line's dedicated server, which `scenarios/server/<loader>/config` gives a `lead_water_range` of 2
against the client's 6, so the tint shows whose setting the client draws by.

The test bodies are 1.21.1's but for seven calls the 1.2 port moved into `TestCompat`: six on 1.21.3 (`trim`,
`trimPalette`, `hasRecipe`, `recipesFor`, `use`, `nearestDirection`), which `version/1.21`'s bodies still make
directly, and `assertTrue` on 1.21.5, since `GameTestHelper.assertTrue` takes only a Component from 1.21.5 to
1.21.10, which the bodies of `version/1.21`, `version/1.21.3` and `version/1.21.4` still call on the helper. Their
`TestCompat`s want those methods in their own forms before the bodies match again.

## This line

- Java 21, Mojang mappings with Parchment. `org.gradle.java.home` is pinned in `gradle.properties` to a JDK on this machine; if the daemon fails to start, check that path first.
- Datagen: `:neoforge:runData`. Output: `common/src/generated/resources`, never hand-edited.
- Game tests in `common/src/gametest`, run on both loaders: `:neoforge:runGameTest` and `:fabric:runGameTest`. Laid out with the test shim above; each loader's `GameTestRegistration` and `TestLoader` are in its own `src/test` (`architectury.md`, "Game tests on Fabric too"). From 1.21.5 Fabric API's own registration takes one annotated method per test, so Fabric's `GameTestRegistration` is the test mod's `main` entrypoint and registers into vanilla's test registries itself, the instances from Fabric's `DynamicRegistrySetupCallback`. NeoForge 21.10 posts `RegisterGameTestsEvent` only while the registries load, before they freeze, so NeoForge's registers wherever it comes, the dedicated server included.
- 13 play scenarios in `scenarios/`, and 1 in `scenarios/server`.
- Entities and block entities save through 1.21.6's `ValueOutput` and read through `ValueInput`. A leaded glass design's colours go through `LeadedGlassConfig.putColors` and `getColors`, a list of dye names that also reads 1.1's array of numbers; `TestCompat.reloaded` saves and loads an entity the same way.
- Particles are 1.21.9's: the mod's own (`LeadSpeckParticle`) are `SingleQuadParticle`s given their sprite as they are made, and only a `SingleQuadParticle` takes a colour, so the purple smoke and fumes tint those. NeoForge's dev client needs no `-Dneoforge.warnings.onlyin.hide`, as 1.21.8's does: Architectury API 18 has no `@OnlyIn`, so NeoForge's warning screen about it doesn't come up.
- JEI's plugin (`compat/jei`, JEI 26.3) shows the leaded glass recipes, info entries and, through `LeadedGlassSubtypes`, each design as its own stack; JEI runs in the dev client but not in the game tests or datagen. EMI has no build past 1.21.1.
- Published with `publishMods` from `fabric/build.gradle` and `neoforge/build.gradle`, with the `-PpublishDryRun` flag. Uploads are tagged from `supported_minecraft_versions`.
- GitHub Actions: `release.yml`.
- Hand-authored access wideners and transformers: `common/src/main/resources/theleadage.accesswidener` and `neoforge/src/main/resources/META-INF/accesstransformer.cfg`. A first suspect when a port fails to load.
